## High Energy Laser Rotating Target
This read me explains the purpose of the different folders and contains a quick start guide.

The various ESP32 files contain code for the Arduino IDE intended to run on the HELTEC ESP32 WiFi Kit attached to the printed circuit board. The file names contain the date of last edit and the focus of what the code is attempting to solve.

The Motor_Control folder contains files for the RoboTeq MotorController. They are written in MicroBasic Script and documentation for the code.

## Quick Start Guide
* ESP32
  * Open the Arduino IDE and select the version of code you wish to run. Follow the instructions found here to select the proper board configuration (https://heltec.org/wifi_kit_install/). Ensure the proper COM port and board are selected from the menus. Upload the code and run the program.
* Motor Control Unit
  * Open RoboTeq on your computer. From within the RoboTeq Program, select the file you wish to run. Ensure that the correct COM port is selected. Once you press run you will need to disable the emercency stop in order for the motor controller to run.
